# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
**INTRODUCTION:-**

Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) is a technology that allows computers to understand and identify letters or numbers written by hand. It is commonly used in things like reading postal addresses, processing bank checks, or converting handwritten notes into digital text.

Machine Learning helps with this by training a computer to recognize patterns in handwriting. First, we collect many examples of handwritten letters or digits. These examples are used to teach the computer what each character looks like, even if different people write them in different ways.

We usually use a type of Machine Learning called Supervised Learning, where each training example is labeled with the correct character. Then, we use models like Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are especially good at working with images
